Welcome to the Node.js Fundamentals Project! This project has been created to begin my studies on Back-End with Node.js and learn its core concepts. I explore Buffers, and streams for reading and writing data, and even create a fake database using JSON files.

## What I learned:

- Buffers: Learn how to work with Buffers in Node.js, which are used for handling binary data.

- Streams: Understand stream concepts for efficient data reading and writing in Node.js.

- Fake Database: Create a simple fake database using JSON files to practice data storage and retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
